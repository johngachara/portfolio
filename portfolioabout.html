    <h2>Who am i?</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently undertaking my  Bachelor's degree in ICT, and my journey as a software engineer has been an exciting adventure of learning and growth. Over the 2years of school experience have allowed me to tackle diverse challenges and refine my technical expertise.
        
        </p>
        <h2>Why Software Engineering?</h2>
        <p>

            To me, software engineering is more than just a career; it's my calling. The thrill of crafting elegant solutions to complex problems fuels my desire to make a positive impact in the digital world. Every line of code I write carries the potential to change lives, and that's what excites me the most.</p>
  <h2>My Skills</h2>
  <p>

    Proficient in Python and armed with a comprehensive knowledge of backend development, I thrive on architecting efficient and reliable systems. In addition, my proficiency in HTML and CSS allows me to craft polished web interfaces that elevate user experiences to new heights.

<p>As much as I value individual expertise, collaboration has always been at the core of my work. I thrive in team environments where diverse minds come together to create something extraordinary. Being part of a supportive team has enriched my problem-solving skills and made me a more adaptable engineer.
